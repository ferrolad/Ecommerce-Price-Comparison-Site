A fingerprint identity sensor. A better, faster camera. And an operating system built specifically for 64-bit. Any one of these features in a smartphone would make it ahead of its time. All of these features in a smartphone make it an iPhone that’s definitely ahead of its time.The gold standardiPhone 5s is precision crafted down to the micron. And it’s evident throughout. The beautiful aluminum housing. The sleekness of metal and glass. Sapphire crystal in the Home button. And more sapphire crystal protecting the iSight camera. Design and construction of this level is unmatched. As a result, iPhone 5s looks and feels unbelievably thin and light. And it’s available in three elegant expressions: gold, silver, and space gray.Touch IDYour fingerprint. Your iPhone.You check your iPhone dozens and dozens of times a day, probably more. Entering a passcode each time just slows you down. But you do it because making sure no one else has access to your iPhone is important. With iPhone 5s, getting into your phone is faster, easier, and even a little futuristic. Introducing Touch ID — a new fingerprint identity sensor.Put your finger on the Home button, and just like that your iPhone unlocks. It’s a convenient and highly secure way to access your phone. Your fingerprint can also approve purchases from iTunes Store, the App Store, and the iBooks Store, so you don’t have to enter your password. And Touch ID is capable of 360-degree readability. Which means no matter what its orientation — portrait, landscape, or anything in between — your iPhone reads your fingerprint and knows who you are. And because Touch ID lets you enroll multiple fingerprints, it knows the people you trust, too.A7 chipThe first 64-bit smartphone in the world.There’s fast. And then there’s A7 fast. The new A7 chip gives you CPU and graphics performance up to 2x faster than the A6 chip. Even more impressive, A7 makes iPhone5s the first 64-bit smartphone in the world — that’s desktop-class architecture in asuperslim phone. And because iOS 7 was built specifically for 64-bit, it’s uniquelydesigned to take advantage of the A7 chip.A7 supports OpenGL ES version3.0 to deliver the kind of detailed graphics and complex visual effects once possibleonly on Mac computers, PCs, and gaming consoles. The difference is amazing. Takethe imaginary worlds in games, for instance. Textures and shadows look more true tolife. Sunlight reflects off the water. The whole experience feels much morerealistic.M7 coprocessor.An entirely new processor.For an entirely new level of efficiency.The new M7 coprocessor is like a sidekick to the A7 chip. It’s designed specifically tomeasure motion data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass — a task thatwould normally fall to the A7 chip. But M7 is much more efficient at it. Now fitness appsthat track physical activity can access that data from the M7 coprocessor withoutconstantly engaging the A7 chip. So they require less battery power.M7 knows when you’re walking, running, or even driving. For example, Maps switchesfrom driving to walking turn-by-turn navigation if, say, you park and continue on foot. Andif your phone hasn’t moved for a while, like when you’re asleep, M7 reduces networkpinging to spare your battery.iSight cameraThe worlds most popular camera gets even better.iPhone 5s features advanced technologies custom designed for the iSight camera’shardware and software.

Indispensable from now on. A chip with 64-bit architecture. A fingerprint identity sensor. A better, faster camera. And an operating system built specifically for 64-bit. Any one of these features in a smartphone would make it ahead of its time. All of these features in a smartphone make it an iPhone thats definitely ahead of its time.  The gold standard iPhone 5s is precision crafted down to the micron. And its evident throughout. The beautiful aluminum housing. The sleekness of metal and glass. Sapphire crystal in the Home button. And more sapphire crystal protecting the iSight camera. Design and construction of this level is unmatched. As a result, iPhone 5s looks and feels unbelievably thin and light. And its available in three elegant expressions: gold, silver, and space gray.   Touch IDYour fingerprint. Your iPhone. You check your iPhone dozens and dozens of times a day, probably more. Entering a passcode each time just slows you down. But you do it because making sure no one else has access to your iPhone is important. With iPhone 5s, getting into your phone is faster, easier, and even a little futuristic. Introducing Touch ID ---a new fingerprint identity sensor.  Put your finger on the Home button, and just like that your iPhone unlocks. Its a convenient and highly secure way to access your phone. Your fingerprint can also approve purchases from iTunes Store, the App Store, and the iBooks Store, so you dont have to enter your password. And Touch ID is capable of 360-degree readability. Which means no matter what its orientation ---portrait, landscape, or anything in between ---your iPhone reads your fingerprint and knows who you are. And because Touch ID lets you enroll multiple fingerprints, it knows the people you trust, too.  A7 chip The first 64-bit smartphone in the world. Theres fast. And then theres A7 fast. The new A7 chip gives you CPU and graphics performance up to 2x faster than the A6 chip. Even more impressive, A7 makes iPhone 5s the first 64-bit smartphone in the world ---thats desktop-class architecture in a superslim phone. And because iOS 7 was built specifically for 64-bit, its uniquely designed to take advantage of the A7 chip.A7 supports OpenGL ES version 3.0 to deliver the kind of detailed graphics and complex visual effects once possible only on Mac computers, PCs, and gaming consoles. The difference is amazing. Take the imaginary worlds in games, for instance. Textures and shadows look more true to life. Sunlight reflects off the water. The whole experience feels much more realistic.  M7 coprocessor. An entirely new processor. For an entirely new level of efficiency. The new M7 coprocessor is like a sidekick to the A7 chip. Its designed specifically to measure motion data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass ---a task that would normally fall to the A7 chip. But M7 is much more efficient at it. Now fitness apps that track physical activity can access that data from the M7 coprocessor without constantly engaging the A7 chip. So they require less battery power.  M7 knows when youre walking, running, or even driving. For example, Maps switches from driving to walking turn-by-turn navigation if, say, you park and continue on foot. And if your phone hasnt moved for a while, like when youre asleep, M7 reduces network pinging to spare your battery.  iSight camera The worlds most popular camera gets even better. iPhone 5s features advanced technologies custom designed for the iSight cameras hardware and software. So anyone anywhere can take an amazing photo at any time. It simply makes more sense to teach iPhone how to take a great picture rather than teach people how to be expert photographers.

HDR (High Dynamic Range) is an imaging technology used to capture clear photos against strong backlight. With HDR, this Bluetooth smartphone captures the same image at different exposure levels and layers them to create one optimised photo.Significantly improve battery life with Battery STAMINA ModeSmartphones use a lot of power, even when you’re not actively using them. All those apps that you have on your Android smartphone may still be running in the background, draining your battery. Battery STAMINA Mode saves you wasted battery drain. It recognises when you’re not using your display and automatically turns off the functions you don’t need, while keeping the notifications you want. As soon as you press the power button to wake up your screen, everything is up and running again.Get only the important noticesWith Battery STAMINA Mode, Wi-Fi and data traffic are disabled during standby, but you still receive incoming calls, texts, and alarms. And since everyone has different needs, you can easily customise which apps you want to receive push notifications from even in standby mode. Facebook notifications on or off? It’s up to you.Lightning speed performance – Dual-core processorWe’ve matched the latest Sony software with the powerful Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ S4 Plus processor. This dual core processor gives your Bluetooth smartphone top performance and speed without draining your battery – run multiple apps simultaneously, surf the web with no loading time, and stream videos without a break. The Snapdragon™ S4 Plus is asynchronous, which means each core is powered up and down independently. So you get the precise amount of power when you need it, without wasting power when you don’t.

A fingerprint identity sensor. A better, faster camera. And an operating system built specifically for 64-bit. Any one of these features in a smartphone would make it ahead of its time. All of these features in a smartphone make it an iPhone that’s definitely ahead of its time.The gold standardiPhone 5s is precision crafted down to the micron. And it’s evident throughout. The beautiful aluminum housing. The sleekness of metal and glass. Sapphire crystal in the Home button. And more sapphire crystal protecting the iSight camera. Design and construction of this level is unmatched. As a result, iPhone 5s looks and feels unbelievably thin and light. And it’s available in three elegant expressions: gold, silver, and space gray.Touch IDYour fingerprint. Your iPhone.You check your iPhone dozens and dozens of times a day, probably more. Entering a passcode each time just slows you down. But you do it because making sure no one else has access to your iPhone is important. With iPhone 5s, getting into your phone is faster, easier, and even a little futuristic. Introducing Touch ID — a new fingerprint identity sensor.Put your finger on the Home button, and just like that your iPhone unlocks. It’s a convenient and highly secure way to access your phone. Your fingerprint can also approve purchases from iTunes Store, the App Store, and the iBooks Store, so you don’t have to enter your password. And Touch ID is capable of 360-degree readability. Which means no matter what its orientation — portrait, landscape, or anything in between — your iPhone reads your fingerprint and knows who you are. And because Touch ID lets you enroll multiple fingerprints, it knows the people you trust, too.A7 chipThe first 64-bit smartphone in the world.There’s fast. And then there’s A7 fast. The new A7 chip gives you CPU and graphics performance up to 2x faster than the A6 chip. Even more impressive, A7 makes iPhone5s the first 64-bit smartphone in the world — that’s desktop-class architecture in asuperslim phone. And because iOS 7 was built specifically for 64-bit, it’s uniquelydesigned to take advantage of the A7 chip.A7 supports OpenGL ES version3.0 to deliver the kind of detailed graphics and complex visual effects once possibleonly on Mac computers, PCs, and gaming consoles. The difference is amazing. Takethe imaginary worlds in games, for instance. Textures and shadows look more true tolife. Sunlight reflects off the water. The whole experience feels much morerealistic.M7 coprocessor.An entirely new processor.For an entirely new level of efficiency.The new M7 coprocessor is like a sidekick to the A7 chip. It’s designed specifically tomeasure motion data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass — a task thatwould normally fall to the A7 chip. But M7 is much more efficient at it. Now fitness appsthat track physical activity can access that data from the M7 coprocessor withoutconstantly engaging the A7 chip. So they require less battery power.M7 knows when you’re walking, running, or even driving. For example, Maps switchesfrom driving to walking turn-by-turn navigation if, say, you park and continue on foot. Andif your phone hasn’t moved for a while, like when you’re asleep, M7 reduces networkpinging to spare your battery.iSight cameraThe worlds most popular camera gets even better.iPhone 5s features advanced technologies custom designed for the iSight camera’shardware and software. So anyone anywhere can take an amazing photo at any time. Itsimply makes more sense to teach iPhone how to take a great picture rather thanteach people how to be expert photographers. Here are just some of the capabilities ofthe new iSight camera.

Indispensable from now on. A chip with 64-bit architecture. A fingerprint identity sensor. A better, faster camera. And an operating system built specifically for 64-bit. Any one of these features in a smartphone would make it ahead of its time. All of these features in a smartphone make it an iPhone thats definitely ahead of its time.  The gold standard iPhone 5s is precision crafted down to the micron. And its evident throughout. The beautiful aluminum housing. The sleekness of metal and glass. Sapphire crystal in the Home button. And more sapphire crystal protecting the iSight camera. Design and construction of this level is unmatched. As a result, iPhone 5s looks and feels unbelievably thin and light. And its available in three elegant expressions: gold, silver, and space gray.   Touch IDYour fingerprint. Your iPhone. You check your iPhone dozens and dozens of times a day, probably more. Entering a passcode each time just slows you down. But you do it because making sure no one else has access to your iPhone is important. With iPhone 5s, getting into your phone is faster, easier, and even a little futuristic. Introducing Touch ID ---a new fingerprint identity sensor.  Put your finger on the Home button, and just like that your iPhone unlocks. Its a convenient and highly secure way to access your phone. Your fingerprint can also approve purchases from iTunes Store, the App Store, and the iBooks Store, so you dont have to enter your password. And Touch ID is capable of 360-degree readability. Which means no matter what its orientation ---portrait, landscape, or anything in between ---your iPhone reads your fingerprint and knows who you are. And because Touch ID lets you enroll multiple fingerprints, it knows the people you trust, too.  A7 chip The first 64-bit smartphone in the world. Theres fast. And then theres A7 fast. The new A7 chip gives you CPU and graphics performance up to 2x faster than the A6 chip. Even more impressive, A7 makes iPhone 5s the first 64-bit smartphone in the world ---thats desktop-class architecture in a superslim phone. And because iOS 7 was built specifically for 64-bit, its uniquely designed to take advantage of the A7 chip.A7 supports OpenGL ES version 3.0 to deliver the kind of detailed graphics and complex visual effects once possible only on Mac computers, PCs, and gaming consoles. The difference is amazing. Take the imaginary worlds in games, for instance. Textures and shadows look more true to life. Sunlight reflects off the water. The whole experience feels much more realistic.  M7 coprocessor. An entirely new processor. For an entirely new level of efficiency. The new M7 coprocessor is like a sidekick to the A7 chip. Its designed specifically to measure motion data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass ---a task that would normally fall to the A7 chip. But M7 is much more efficient at it. Now fitness apps that track physical activity can access that data from the M7 coprocessor without constantly engaging the A7 chip. So they require less battery power.  M7 knows when youre walking, running, or even driving. For example, Maps switches from driving to walking turn-by-turn navigation if, say, you park and continue on foot. And if your phone hasnt moved for a while, like when youre asleep, M7 reduces network pinging to spare your battery.  iSight camera The worlds most popular camera gets even better. iPhone 5s features advanced technologies custom designed for the iSight cameras hardware and software. So anyone anywhere can take an amazing photo at any time. It simply makes more sense to teach iPhone how to take a great picture rather than teach people how to be expert photographers. Here are just some of the capabilities of the new iSight camera.
